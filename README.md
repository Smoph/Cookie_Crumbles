Modified Implementation of a Milk-Delivery System

Requirements (as specified by the "Customer"):

A system is to be produced that holds details of deliveries of
different brands of milk in a small town. As well as recording which
households take which brand(s) of milk, this system also includes
billing details and details of customer vacations when milk will not
be delivered. The household phones the delivery company to change
the personal information, such as an address, to inform the company
of a vacation, and to change an order. For each delivery person, the
system prints a daily list of which brands of milk are to be delivered
to which households. The system is able to produce summary
information showing how many liters of each milk type were sold
each day of the week. Bills for each customer are printed at the end
of each month and left with the first delivery of the following month.
The system also produces appropriate error messages, confirmations,
and warnings.
